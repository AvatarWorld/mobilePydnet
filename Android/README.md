# Android app for Pydnet Demo

Android app for demo purposes.
Compiled for Android 9 (API 28), but it can be compiled also with lower API versions.

**DISCLAIMER**: this is not a commercial-ready application, but a simple demo-app. 
The overall experience can be further improved (for instance, the phone rotation handling)
