## Model
The network has been trained on [MatterPort](https://matterport.com/it/) dataset for 1.2M steps, using the BerHu loss on Microsoft Kinect depth labels offered by the dataset as supervision.

## Android
The code is based on [Google android examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android).
Android `target` version is 26 while `minimum` is 21. Android Studio is required.

Currently, we use `tensorflow-android` instead of `tf-lite`, and no gpu-optimisation is supported.

**Mode**: portrait

## iOS
The demo on iOS has been developed by [Giulio Zaccaroni](https://github.com/GZaccaroni).

XCode is required to build the app, moreover you need to sign in with your AppleID and trust yourself as certified developer.

**Mode**: landscape

### iOS Examples
